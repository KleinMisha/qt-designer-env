# Qt-Designer app 
The qt-designer application (for python projects) is installed via `pyqt6-tools`, and requires a specific (older) version of `python` and `pyqt6`. 


This app can then be used to generate `.ui` files used in `PyQt6` applications. 

## Run the Designer app 
1. Activate this python environment: 
    ```zsh
    source qt-designer-env/.venv/bin/activate
    ```
2. Launch the application: 
   ```zsh
   pyqt6-tools designer
    ```
